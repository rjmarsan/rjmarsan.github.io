# I help engineers tell the best story of their work
I put their work in the best light, coach them through the growth process from entry-level software engineer up through senior and staff engineering.

From promotion packets to tech specs, I have experience crafting clear communication, confident language, and consistent messaging, and mentor engineers through the same journey. 

## What I can help with
* Promotion Packets
* Performance Reflections
* Peer Reviews
* Technical Presentations & Specs
* Growth Guidance

## How I can help
I'm happy to be a mentor from square 1, put out the fire of "fsck my perf packet is due in 2 days and i'm swamped", or just word-smithing for that extra shine.

## Let's do this
Hit me up on [instagram](https://instagram.com/rjmarsan), [twitter](https://twitter.com/rjmarsan) or Android Study Group `@rjmarsan` with your questions and we'll take it from there. I'll be fair and upfront, quick and confidential. I used to hate this kind of work, now it's fun. Go figure.


# About me
I'm [RJ Marsan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmarsan/). I've been working in the SF Bay tech scene since 2010 at some of the biggest names in tech: Google, Lyft and Hulu. 
I've scaled the corperate ladder from entry level Software Engineer to Staff Engineer, Manager, and now proudly taking a long overdue break from the grind. Usually you'll find me on my bike or hanging at a coffee shop.
