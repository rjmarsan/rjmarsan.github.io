# I help engineers tell the best story of their work
Life at tech corperations shouldn't be all about "playing the game", and I'm here to help.

I put Software Engineer's work in the best light, coach them through the growth process from entry-level software engineer up through senior and staff engineering. All without the corporate BS. Finding it hard to learn from "canonical coworkers" as examples? Been there..

From promotion packets to tech specs, I have experience crafting clear communication, confident language, and consistent messaging. I've been mentoring engineers for years through the same journey of defining their own personal story and why they excel in tech. 

If you're looking to reach the next level of your career, make a big move at a new company, or just get the credit you deserve for your work, I'm here to help.

## What I can help with
* Promotion Packets
* Performance Reflections
* Peer Reviews
* Interviewing
* Resume, Cover Letters
* Technical Presentations & Specs
* Growth Guidance

## How I can help
I'm happy to be a mentor from square 1, put out the fire of "fsck my perf packet is due in 2 days and i'm swamped", or just word-smithing for that extra shine.

## Let's do this
Hit me up on [instagram](https://instagram.com/rjmarsan), [twitter](https://twitter.com/rjmarsan) or Android Study Group `@rjmarsan` with your questions and we'll take it from there. I'll be fair and upfront, quick and confidential. I used to hate this kind of work, now it's fun. Go figure.


# About me
I'm [RJ Marsan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rjmarsan/). I've been working in the SF Bay tech scene since 2010 at some of the biggest names in tech: Google, Lyft and Hulu. 
I've scaled the corperate ladder from entry level Software Engineer to Staff Engineer, Manager, and now proudly taking a long overdue break from the grind. Usually you'll find me on my bike or hanging at a coffee shop.
